This repository contains a ML prediction model about a fititious hospital, Sidra Hospital, kuwait, to determine the likely hood of heart disease in their patients based on their test results. 
With the data provided, I'm going to try to predict the potential of heart disease in patients based on the presence of a conbination of the various enzymens within the blood along with other 
factors usch as gender, smoking habits, diabetes, etc., that can lead to heart failure and subsequently death. Being able to predict this will enable to prevent heart failure in their patients and save thie lives

The data will be sourced by collecton records of the various test perfroemd on patients that happend to pass away from heart failure. 
Using this date ill try to make a pipleline that can predcit hear failure in patients
